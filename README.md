# Rock Paper Scissors
This Rock Paper Scissors project is a console-based game implementation built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project demonstrates fundamental skills in JavaScript, specifically focusing on game logic, functions, and loops.

## Live Demo
Check out the live version of the project here: **[Rock Paper Scissors Live Demo](https://andrea441.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)**

*(Note: You will need to open your browser's Developer Tools Console to see the game output)*

## Description
This project is a practice exercise to test and build competency in:
* Writing JavaScript functions to handle game logic (`getComputerChoice`, `playRound`, `playGame`).
* Using conditionals (`if/else`) to determine the winner of each round based on classic rules.
* Implementing loops (`for`) to play a set number of rounds (5 rounds per game).
* Interacting with the user via `prompt()` and displaying results using `console.log()`.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: Used as a container to link and execute the JavaScript file.
* **JavaScript**: Used for the entire game logic. Key concepts applied include:
* **Functions**: Breaking down the code into reusable pieces like `getComputerChoice` and `playRound`.
* **Math Object**: Using `Math.random()` to generate random computer choices.
* **Control Flow**: Using `if/else` statements to compare choices (Rock vs. Scissors, etc.) and assign scores.
* **Console Interaction**: The game runs entirely in the browser console, logging the progress and final score.

## How to Use
You can play the game directly in your browser or run it from your computer.

### Option 1: Online (Recommended)
Simply visit the **[Live Demo](https://andrea441.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)**.

### Option 2: Run Locally
If you prefer to run the code on your machine:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Game Instructions
Once you have the page open (Online or Local):
1. **Open the Console**: Right-click anywhere on the page, select **Inspect**, and go to the **Console** tab.
2. **Start**: Refresh the page to trigger the game.
3. **Interact**: A prompt will appear asking for your choice ("rock", "paper", or "scissors").
4. **Results**: The game plays 5 rounds and the results are displayed in the console.
